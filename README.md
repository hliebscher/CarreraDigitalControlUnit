# cardiff

Carrera® DIGITAL 124/132 C++ interface library for Arduino/mbed.

This project is at a *very* early stage.  Currently, it is no more
than a simple protocol logger loosely based on Peter Niehues' [Arduino
decoder](http://www.wasserstoffe.de/carrera-hacks/protocol-decode/index.html).

You probably don't want to mess with this for now, but stay tuned...
